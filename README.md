# üß™ AI-Based Drug Toxicity Prediction using SMILES & RDKit

Predicting the **toxicological impact of chemical compounds** is a critical step in early-stage drug discovery. This project leverages **cheminformatics**, **machine learning**, and **SMILES-based molecular representation** to predict the potential toxicity of compounds using the **Tox21 dataset** ‚Äî all before entering costly clinical trials.

## üî¨ Problem Statement

Late-stage drug failures due to **toxicity** not only waste resources but also risk patient safety. Traditional toxicological testing is slow, expensive, and dependent on animal models.

**Goal:** Use AI to predict whether a given molecule is toxic (specifically, active on the NR-AR endpoint) using its SMILES representation ‚Äî helping scientists eliminate risky compounds early in the pipeline.

## üß† Why AI for Toxicity?

AI can:
- üö´ Identify toxic compounds *before* synthesis
- üß™ Reduce dependence on animal models
- üí∞ Save millions in development costs
- ‚è±Ô∏è Accelerate the drug discovery cycle

By encoding chemical structure into machine-readable formats and training models on known toxic/non-toxic examples, we can forecast outcomes for new, unseen molecules.

  - Number of Rotatable Bonds
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors

### 2. **Model Training**
- Model: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy: **~96%**
  - ROC AUC: **0.74**
  - Confusion matrix and classification report

### 3. **Visualization**
- Class distribution histogram
- Feature importance bar plot
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve with AUC
- **3D Molecule Viewer** (Py3Dmol) for visual inspection
