# 🧪 AI-Based Drug Toxicity Prediction using SMILES & RDKit

Predicting the **toxicological impact of chemical compounds** is a critical step in early-stage drug discovery. This project leverages **cheminformatics**, **machine learning**, and **SMILES-based molecular representation** to predict the potential toxicity of compounds using the **Tox21 dataset** — all before entering costly clinical trials.

---

## 🔬 Problem Statement

Late-stage drug failures due to **toxicity** not only waste resources but also risk patient safety. Traditional toxicological testing is slow, expensive, and dependent on animal models.

**Goal:** Use AI to predict whether a given molecule is toxic (specifically, active on the NR-AR endpoint) using its SMILES representation — helping scientists eliminate risky compounds early in the pipeline.

## 🧠 Why AI for Toxicity?

AI can:
- 🚫 Identify toxic compounds *before* synthesis
- 🧪 Reduce dependence on animal models
- 💰 Save millions in development costs
- ⏱️ Accelerate the drug discovery cycle

By encoding chemical structure into machine-readable formats and training models on known toxic/non-toxic examples, we can forecast outcomes for new, unseen molecules.
